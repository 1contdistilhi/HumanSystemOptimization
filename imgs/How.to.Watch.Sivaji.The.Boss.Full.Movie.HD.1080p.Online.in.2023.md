## The Plot of Sivaji: The Boss
 
The film begins with Sivaji (Rajinikanth) being interrogated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for money laundering charges. He narrates his life story to them, revealing how he became a successful software engineer in the US and decided to return to India with his wealth. He wants to use his money to build schools and hospitals for the poor, but he faces many hurdles from Adiseshan (Suman), a powerful businessman and politician who controls the education and health sectors. Adiseshan tries to sabotage Sivaji's plans by bribing officials, creating legal troubles and even attempting to kill him. Sivaji also falls in love with Tamizhselvi (Shriya Saran), a traditional girl who is Adiseshan's relative.
 
Sivaji manages to overcome Adiseshan's obstacles and launches his free educational project. However, Adiseshan uses his influence to freeze Sivaji's bank accounts and assets, leaving him penniless. Sivaji is arrested by the CBI for possessing black money, which was actually planted by Adiseshan. Sivaji escapes from custody and devises a clever plan to expose Adiseshan's corruption and recover his money. He disguises himself as a bald man named MGR and hacks into Adiseshan's accounts, transferring his money to various charitable trusts. He also exposes Adiseshan's illegal activities to the media and the public, ruining his reputation and career.
 
Sivaji then reveals his true identity to Adiseshan and challenges him to a fight. The two engage in a fierce battle on the terrace of a skyscraper, where Sivaji defeats Adiseshan and throws him off the building. Sivaji is hailed as a hero by the people and resumes his social service projects. He also marries Tamizhselvi and lives happily ever after.
